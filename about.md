## Many names

Offline and online, I have gone by many names.

Until 2017, I went by `Garth`, my first name, and then I started going by my middle name `Troy`.

Online, I've had many identities going back to 1985 as `darkstar`. At the moment, I'm primarily associated with the following:

* Github: [@ambled](https://www.github.com/ambled)
* Discord: [\_xd7\_](https://discord.com/users/_xd7_)

## Projects

I have recently been donating my resources to [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com), a decentralized storage solution I have been following since 2012.

* [ANT Faucet](https://ant.xd7.org) - Is a tool that dispenses network testing tokens to members of the [autonomi community forum](https://forum.autonomi.community/).
* [wnm](https://github.com/iweave/weave-node-manager) - Weave Node Manager, an in-progress node management tool.
* Autonomi Transaction Reporter - A tool that will correlate the asset allocation of multiple crypto wallets engaged in Autonomi transactions on the live network.

## History

I have had an extensive career, first working part time at a (family) factory and doing chores for neighbors as a child. I started food service at 14 and got my first real exposure to customer service problems right away.

My first tech job was the summer of my first year in college, I rewrote the Point Of Sale and backoffice systems for a Fuel Station company in Long Beach. It got me hooked on solving problems with code.

I varied jobs over the next few years until I had an encounter with a team member on the Operations Team, complaining about how the engineers dropped code that needed to be run without consideration for the hardware requirements and lead times necessary to deploy the request.
I took that information to heart and boldly thought, I bet I can learn better ways to deploy code in a few years and transitioned to Operations roles at the same company.

In 1995, I co-launched a Web Hosting business. I designed the tech stack and did consulting for companies that wanted to onboard to the Internet in my spare time.

In 1998 I officially joined the startup world and a whirlwind of roles with companies who struggled to gain or maintain traction.

In 2010, I turned off the lights of the Web Hosting business to focus on decentralized projects (Weave)

In 2012, I launched the first Weave project, a node operator powered by Datafiniti. Sadly, Datafinity decomissioned the network in 2014.

Around this time, the way I had been treating engineering/operations with agile kinds of communication became formalized into a concept called DevOps.  I ran a few large clusters, proving that infrastructure can be treated as code and run at scale.

But, I just wanted this all to work, so now I get to focus back on the Dev side of DevOps.
